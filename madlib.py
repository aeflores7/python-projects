After a long day of walking past "+loc+" they both decided it was best to sleep on their "+bp+" and had a restful night. When day came, both woke up to the smell of waffles and instantly "+verb+ " to the smell. After a quick breakfast, both Toad and "+ani+" went on a journey to go to Toad's house. Using their "+abp+ " they flew into the sky and landed in front of Toad's house. Both lived there happily ever after.")
